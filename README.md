# BLOCKING
Tools for assessing convergence of Molecular Dynamics simulations by error analysis of calculated ensemble averages and free energies

- Reblocking of mono-dimensional serially correlated unbiased data series (e.g. Collective variables)

- Reblocking approach for mono-dimensional biased CVs (WTMetaD with 1 CV or PBMetaD)
[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9608-7_21]

- Automatic selection of correlation length and standard error of the mean

- Tools for analyses
